This ReleaseNotes.txt was added by the author on request from a user.  Until now, the author wasn't aware that the
application actually had any users!

Please note that RADRunner is currently in beta. Until version 1.0, binary compatibility between releases is not
guaranteed.  When a new build has a binary break, it will be mentioned here.  Once version 1.0 is released, it will
contain a mechanism for detecting incompatible client and server versions.

New releases that are built by GitHub may or may not contain improvements, as the builds are triggered automatically
by code merges, so sometimes a build contains only internal non functional changes.

If a build does contain a new feature or bugfix, I'll try to remember to add it to this file with the build's release
date.

Have fun with the Amiga!
