This ReleaseNotes.txt was added by the author on request from a user.  Until now, the author wasn't aware that the
application actually had any users!

Please note that RADRunner is currently in beta. Until version 1.0, binary compatibility between releases is not
guaranteed.  When a new build has a binary break, it will be mentioned here.  Once version 1.0 is released, it will
contain a mechanism for detecting incompatible client and server versions.

New releases that are built by GitHub may or may not contain improvements, as the builds are triggered automatically
by code merges, so sometimes a build contains only internal non functional changes.

If a build does contain a new feature or bugfix, I'll try to remember to add it to this file with the build's release
date.

Have fun with the Amiga!

Version 0.03 (2025.05.17):

  - Bug Fix: The Amiga OS version of the "execute" command was crashing on OS4. Many thanks to Colin Wenzel of the OS4
    development team for his help in resolving this issue!

Version 0.02 (2025.02.10):

  - Bug fix: The Amiga OS version of the "execute" command was launching executables with the default system stack size
    of 4096 bytes, causing instability.  A default stack size of 20k is now used, and a custom stack size can be
    specified by the client.  See the documentation for further details.

  - Bumped protocol version to v0.2, as this is a breaking change.  All clients must be updated, as this version is not
    compabible with protocol v0.1.

Version 0.01 (2024.04.24):

  - First public release

  - Added ability to specify the server port as a part of the remote host name, for example localhost:8080
