Regarding the release status of RADRunner, it is currently in beta.  New releases
that are built by GitHub may or may not contain improvements, as the builds are
triggered automatically by code merges, so sometimes a build contains only internal
non functional changes.

If a build does contain a new feature or bugfix, I'll try to remember to add it to
this file with the build's release date.

Have fun with the Amiga!
